Style Guide V1.0

Python
General Formatting:
  Use 4 "spaces/whitespace" for indentation not "tabs"

  Use "" not '' for strings
    "Hello World" vs 'Hello World'

  Make varible names descriptive but within reason
    i.e startTime, endTime vs t1,t2

  Camel case for Varibles and Functions. Function Start Capitilized, Varibles start lowercase
    startTime = 12
    ComplexCalcFunct(x,y,z)
  Allcaps for classes
    class DATASTORAGE:
        class body  
    
Comment Stuctures:
  At the start of functions
    # What the function does and what it returns 
    # Description of the varibles
    # Last person to modify the function
    # Last person's changes
    def complexCalcFunct(x,y,z):
        do something

  Add comments for complicated bits of math and logic
  Even if it seems simple for you add a comment
    # ComplexCalcFunct does magic math
    this = ComplexCalcFunct(x,y,z)
    if (this is that)
        #"that is this" and "this and that" are not comunicative so IDK
        if (that is this)
        {
             do something
        }

Practices:
  Isolate tasks into their own .py file and then import them into main .py when neaded.
  
  Always check in other source files if the function you're programming already exists, if so use that one.
  
  Try to use switch statments rather than if-else blocks if you're checking for equality, this is mainly for read
  ablity.
